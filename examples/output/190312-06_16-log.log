tokens: [CLS] when did the frankish identity emerge ? [SEP] the norman ##s ( norman : no ##ur ##man ##ds ; french : norman ##ds ; latin : norman ##ni ) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy , a region in france . they were descended from norse ( " norman " comes from " norse ##man " ) raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader roll ##o , agreed to swear fe ##al ##ty to king charles iii of west fran ##cia . through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native frankish and roman - gaul ##ish populations , their descendants would gradually merge with the carol ##ing ##ian - based cultures of west fran ##cia . the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the norman ##s emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries .

tokens: [CLS] what river originally bounded the duchy [SEP] in the course of the 10th century , the initially destructive inc ##urs ##ions of norse war bands into the rivers of france evolved into more permanent en ##camp ##ments that included local women and personal property . the duchy of normandy , which began in 911 as a fi ##ef ##dom , was established by the treaty of saint - clair - sur - ep ##te between king charles iii of west fran ##cia and the famed viking ruler roll ##o , and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of ne ##ust ##ria . the treaty offered roll ##o and his men the french lands between the river ep ##te and the atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further viking inc ##urs ##ions . the area corresponded to the northern part of present - day upper normandy down to the river seine , but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine . the territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of rouen , and reproduced the roman administrative structure of gall ##ia lu ##g ##dun ##ensis ii ( part of the former gall ##ia lu ##g ##dun ##ensis ) .
